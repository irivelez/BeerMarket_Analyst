## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- OpenAI API key ([get one here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))
- Serper API key ([get one here](https://serper.dev/api-key))

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/irivelez/BeerMarket_Analyst.git
cd BeerMarket_Analyst
```

2. **Create virtual environment and install dependencies**
```bash
# Using uv (recommended)
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or using standard venv
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Configure API keys**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your keys:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
SERPER_API_KEY=your_serper_api_key_here
```

4. **Run the analysis**
```bash
python main.py
```

Expected runtime: **5-15 minutes**

## Why This Exists

Traditional market research is time-consuming and expensive. This project demonstrates how multi-agent AI systems can automate the initial research phase, providing:

- **Speed**: 15 minutes vs weeks of manual research
- **Cost**: Just API Costs
- **Comprehensiveness**: Parallel analysis across multiple dimensions
- **Objectivity**: Data-driven insights from public sources

---

## Features

‚úÖ **Token-optimized** - Designed to work within OpenAI rate limits
‚úÖ **Configurable** - Easy to adjust countries, segments, or focus areas
‚úÖ **Sequential workflow** - Tasks build on each other for coherent analysis
‚úÖ **Public data only** - No proprietary databases required
‚úÖ **Automated synthesis** - Combines multiple data sources into actionable insights

---

## Limitations

- **Data recency** - Limited to publicly available online information
- **Accuracy** - Estimates may vary; should be validated with primary research
- **Scope** - Focuses on top 3 countries (configurable to all 6)
- **API costs** - Requires active OpenAI and Serper subscriptions
- **Language** - Primarily searches English-language sources

> **Note:** This tool is for initial research and opportunity identification. Always validate findings with on-the-ground market research before major investment decisions.
